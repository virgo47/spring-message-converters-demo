= Spring HTTP message converters demo

This repository contains multiple miniature Spring Boot applications in separate sub-packages:

* `demo1` - default Spring Boot + Web MVC auto-configuration with a few REST endpoints.

* `demo1b` - `demo1` with disabled `WebMvcAutoConfiguration`, very limited message conversions.

* `demo1c` - `demo1` again but with `@EnableWebMvc`, now things work again, but configuration is a bit different.

* `demo2` - `demo1` but with custom `@Configuration` implementing `WebMvcConfigurer` added.
This one does not disable auto-configuration and more than expected number of converters are used.

* `demo2b` - like `demo2`, but this time we use `@EnableWebMvc` and take full responsibility for the setup.

* `demo3` - TODO: customization of order when multiple converters match.
